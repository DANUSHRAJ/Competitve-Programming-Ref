Prime Pairs - Differ by 6

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must
print the pairs of prime integers that differ by 6 in the given range from
2 to N. The pairs must be printed in the order of their occurrence.
Note: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceeded error.
Boundary Condition(s):
11 <= N <= 10^6
Input Format:
The first line co ntains N.
Output Format:
The lines, each co ntaining the pairs of prime integers separated by a
space.
